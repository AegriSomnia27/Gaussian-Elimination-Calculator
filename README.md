# Gaussian-Elimination-Calculator
My implementation of Gaussian Elimination
Using bubble sort algorithm, a matrix is reduced to the form, that has the biggest numbers on the main diagonal of the matrix.
Then by choosing the pivot elements (these are already on the main diagonal) the matrix is reduced to the echelon form.
After that calculations are made to compute the-latest-to-the-first unknown variables of the system of linear equations.
